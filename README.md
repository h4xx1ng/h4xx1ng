I tend to dissocialize much,so don't mind me if i suddenly walk away from a cuddle pile or just crowds overall! c+h is much appreciated unless I'm with my partner or friends,or i have "dniu.." in my name. I like making new friends, although i might be giving dry responses at first unless i grew really close to you. w2i is preferred.
